# SEPIRA
Systems EPigenomics Inference of Regulatory Activity
SEPIRA is a novel systems-epigenomics algorithm which estimates activity of a regulator (e.g. a transcription factor) in a sample for which
there is a transcriptome or DNA methylome profile available. Briefly, it takes as input a large gene expression dataset encompassing many
different tissue types (user must provide this) and for a tissue of interest, it construct a tissue-specific regulatory network. From this
network it then estimates regulatory activity for a sample with an input expression or DNA methylation profile.
